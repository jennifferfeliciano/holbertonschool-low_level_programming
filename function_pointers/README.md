	- Unlike normal pointers, a function pointer points to code, not data. Typically a function pointer stores the start of executable code.

	-Unlike normal pointers, we do not allocate de-allocate memory using function pointers.

	-A function’s name can also be used to get functions’ address.

	-Function pointer can be used in place of switch case.

	-Like normal data pointers, a function pointer can be passed as an argument and can also be returned from a function.
